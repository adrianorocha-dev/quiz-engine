# Quiz Engine

## Global Requirements

### Objective

Develop a quiz engine using React and CSS/SCSS that renders quiz questions one by one based on a JSON structure. The quiz engine should support different types of questions, including:

- One-choice
- Multiple-choice
- Input questions

Additionally, it should support conditional navigation between questions based on user answers. Each slide, apart from the question itself, can have an image, title, and description.
